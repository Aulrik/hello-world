# hello-world

This is all a part of my github familiarization process.

I am joining github in hopes of expanding my now, near non-existant knowledge of programming!
I am currently about to begin my journey on FreeCodeCamp.  Which, while I have heard of GitHub before, is responsible for prompting me to make an actual accoune and get started.  I doubt I will be using GitHub much to begin with, as I imagine I will be spending most of my time studying.  But I am sure that, in time, I will come to rely quite heavily on the input of this community.
